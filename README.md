# Tips for new developers

I've worked for a number of years now and have been similar things in a number of new developers when they face the difference between school and industry, so to speed things up a bit I thought I'd write these down.

## Pace your learning

Some developers want to learn all of the codebase when they begin their new job. At some places this doesn't work at all or at some it might take a year. Your employer doesn't have a year for you to just learn, you have to be productive as well. Take a task, learn related things to that when solving it and then take the next one.

It's good to get a grip of the architecture, how the big pieces fit together, but don't try to learn the insides of all the pieces right away.

## Code review critique

Code review is not personal. We're critizing your code, not you. You need to seperate the two or things will be really hard for you going forward.

## Specification issues

The spec might be incorrect or could be improved. Talk to someone if you see an issue. 
It might be an issue, then you will make it better.
It might be a compromise due to something else, then you will learn more about the code base and product.
It might be you misunderstanding, then you will learn more and implement it correctly.

## Old unknown code

"Ah, the ThingyDoer. Bob wrote that, he quit two years ago and nobody has really touched it since."

It might be the case that nobody currently working in the company knows how a piece of code works. You'll have to dig down and figure it out yourself.

## Tech debt

"Ah, the ThingyDoer. Bob wrote that before a deadline and it works but it's horrible. We just never got around to cleaning it up."

Similar but not the same as above. It might have been a rush job, working fine but ugly. It might have been a good fit for the product as it was five years ago but isn't any more.

## When receiving help, don't interrupt

If someone takes the time to explain something, don't interrupt.

## A touch of humility never hurts

To use a clich√©, If you talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk or people will be annoyed. Some of the people I've worked with in the past were really annoying to work with and not that great developers, which means I'll actively tro to disuade current employers to hire them. I really doubt I'm alone in that.

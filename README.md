# Tips for new developers

I've worked for a number of years now and have been similar things in a number of new developers when they face the difference between school and industry, so to speed things up a bit I thought I'd write these down to gather my thougths.

It started to grow a bit so I've split it into sections.

- [Social](social.md)
- [Technical](technical.md)
- [Career](career.md)
- [Personal](personal.md)

## Education

How can these points be taught in the best way? I'm not sure. Suggestions very welcome.

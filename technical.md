# Technical

## Specification issues

The spec might be incorrect or could be improved. Talk to someone if you see an issue. 
It might be an issue, then you will make it better.
It might be a compromise due to something else, then you will learn more about the code base and product.
It might be you misunderstanding, then you will learn more and implement it correctly.

## Old unknown code

"Ah, the ThingyDoer. Sara wrote that, she quit two years ago and nobody has really touched it since."

It might be the case that nobody currently working in the company knows how a piece of code works. You'll have to dig down and figure it out yourself.

## Tech debt

"Ah, the ThingyDoer. Bob wrote that before a deadline and it works but it's horrible. We just never got around to cleaning it up."

Similar but not the same as above. It might have been a rush job, working fine but ugly. It might have been a good fit for the product as it was five years ago but isn't any more.

If you do take a shortcut when facing a deadline, make sure people know about it. Never hide tech debt.

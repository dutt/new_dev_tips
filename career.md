# Career

## Everyone starts somewhere

Everybody takes a month or three to get going at a new place. Don't worry too much during the first few months, just give it your best shot and try to learn a lot.

Your goals with your first job should be two:

1) A decent starting salary.
2) Learning opportunities. Find out which areas in development you enjoy and how to do more of those while less of the less fun ones.

The first job is the first stepping stone to your next job, which ideally would have a higher salary and higher ratio of the fun stuff.

## Switch companies

It's good to see different environments, ways of working, toolchains and expand your network. It's also usually the fastest way to climb in salary. Don't switch too often though, I try to stay ~1-1Â½ years at least.

## Evalute the company

Provisonal hiring is good for the company, they can evaluate you and your potential as an employee. It's also good for you, you can evalute the company culture, your coworkers, boss and so on. Use that opportunity.

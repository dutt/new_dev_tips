## Mentor

Try to find somebody more senior that knows how to give good critique that you get along with, ask them if they might want to mentor you for a bit. Think of it as a senior/friend thing.
How do you handle this or that boss / colleague?
How do you get things like this approved for implementation?
Which interesting new projects might be coming up?
How'd they solve this or that interesting problem?

## Ask for help

It's a lot better for eveyone if you ask a colleague the same day than if you're stuck at a problem for a week.

Nobody knows everything. I've worked for a couple of years now and still ask questions, search and find new things I didn't know more or less daily.

## Interruptions

If someone takes the time to explain something, don't interrupt.

As you know it can take time to get into the mindset again. Try to time questions before/after meetings or lunch or breaks to help maximize peoples flow. If you have to interrupt try take a batch of questions at once.

## A touch of humility never hurts

To use a clich√©, If you talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk or people will be annoyed. The better you are the more leeway you have. But the best also have to play decent with the others.

## Handling failure

If something doesn't go according to plan let people know, they'll help you clean it up and you learn to not do that again. If it's A LOT of cleanup maybe bring cookies or buy them a beer or something, that's always appreciated.

Do not try to hide it or you might make it so much worse.

Good people don't worry about who to blame, good people worry about how to fix the situation. You should aspire to be good people.

## Pace your learning

Some developers want to learn all of the codebase when they begin their new job. At some places this doesn't work at all or at some it might take a year. Your employer doesn't have a year for you to just learn, you have to be productive as well. Take a task, learn related things to that when solving it and then take the next one.

It's good to get a grip of the architecture, how the big pieces fit together, but don't try to learn the insides of all the pieces right away.

## Code review critique

Code review can get harsh, you need to learn to seperate issues in your code from your value as a person. When starting working as a developer you've chosen to expose that side of yourself and you need to be able to take constructive critisism.

## Imposter syndrome

Ever feel like you don't really belong? that you're a fraud and any day now people might realize that you don't really know your stuff and fire you? Welcome to imposter syndrome.

In short, it's a disparity between how we percieve our own skills and how others percieve them.

I don't really have any suggestions here, I've been struggling for years with this one so this is more an awareness section. If you do feel like this you're far from alone. Try to give your self a break and believe others when the sing your praises.

## Free time / Bringing work home

For 95% of the time your work life is a marathon, not a sprint. This means we have to rest, recouperate and be ready for the next week too. Because there's always the next week, the next release and so on. They don't need to be temples but take care of your mind and body decently well. You'll need both.

Of course there's always some grind before an important release, but if you're at a company where they have a lot of grind and don't value your free time maybe think about moving.

This is a two parter:
1) Doing what we enjoy
2) "I should do more"

### Doing what we love 

For a lot of developers we're getting paid for doing what we enjoy, what we do in our free time.
This can lead to worklife and homelife blending together into one, giving the brain little or no rest. Take it from one who's burnt out, it's unpleasant. I'd really advise against it.

### I should do more

Have you had a slow day? did you expect to get more done but suddently the clock skipped a couple of hours? That's ok, we all have slow days. Go home, rest up and you get another crack at it tomorrow.

## How long should this take?

The billion dollar question which has plagued software engineering for the last 50 year; time estimates. In short there's a lot of ways to do it, some don't do it but in general you shouldn't have to worry about this as a new developer. You and your team work together on your estimates, if you're more alone on that specific task either ask somebody more senior for help with estimating it or tell your boss that your estimate has a very high degree of uncertainity.

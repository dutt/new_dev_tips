# Tips for new developers

I've worked for a number of years now and have been similar things in a number of new developers when they face the difference between school and industry, so to speed things up a bit I thought I'd write these down to gather my thougths.

## Pace your learning

Some developers want to learn all of the codebase when they begin their new job. At some places this doesn't work at all or at some it might take a year. Your employer doesn't have a year for you to just learn, you have to be productive as well. Take a task, learn related things to that when solving it and then take the next one.

It's good to get a grip of the architecture, how the big pieces fit together, but don't try to learn the insides of all the pieces right away.

## Everyone starts somewhere

Everybody takes a month or three to get going at a new place. Don't worry too much during the first few months, just give it your best shot and try to learn a lot.

Your goals with your first job should be two:

1) A decent starting salary.
2) Learning opportunities. Find out which areas in development you enjoy and how to do more of those while less of the less fun ones.

The first job is the first stepping stone to your next job, which ideally would have a higher salary and higher ratio of the fun stuff.

## Code review critique

Code review can get harsh, you need to learn to seperate issues in your code from your value as a person. When starting working as a developer you've chosen to expose that side of yourself and you need to be able to take constructive critisism.

## Mentor

Try to find somebody more senior that knows how to give good critique that you get along with, ask them if they might want to mentor you for a bit. Think of it as a senior/friend thing.
How do you handle this or that boss / colleague?
How do you get things like this approved for implementation?
Which interesting new projects might be coming up?
How'd they solve this or that interesting problem?

## Specification issues

The spec might be incorrect or could be improved. Talk to someone if you see an issue. 
It might be an issue, then you will make it better.
It might be a compromise due to something else, then you will learn more about the code base and product.
It might be you misunderstanding, then you will learn more and implement it correctly.

## Old unknown code

"Ah, the ThingyDoer. Sara wrote that, she quit two years ago and nobody has really touched it since."

It might be the case that nobody currently working in the company knows how a piece of code works. You'll have to dig down and figure it out yourself.

## Tech debt

"Ah, the ThingyDoer. Bob wrote that before a deadline and it works but it's horrible. We just never got around to cleaning it up."

Similar but not the same as above. It might have been a rush job, working fine but ugly. It might have been a good fit for the product as it was five years ago but isn't any more.

If you do take a shortcut when facing a deadline, make sure people know about it. Never hide tech debt.

## Ask for help

It's a lot better for eveyone if you ask a colleague the same day than if you're stuck at a problem for a week.

## Interruptions

If someone takes the time to explain something, don't interrupt.

As you know it can take time to get into the mindset again. Try to time questions before/after meetings or lunch or breaks to help maximize peoples flow. If you have to interrupt try take a batch of questions at once.

## A touch of humility never hurts

To use a clich√©, If you talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk or people will be annoyed. The better you are the more leeway you have. But the best also have to play decent with the others.

# Imposter syndrome

Ever feel like you don't really belong? that you're a fraud and any day now people might realize that you don't really know your stuff and fire you? Welcome to imposter syndrome.

In short, it's a disparity between how we percieve our own skills and how others percieve them.

I don't really have any suggestions here, I've been struggling for years with this one so this is more an awareness section. If you do feel like this you're far from alone. Try to give your self a break and believe others when the sing your praises.

# Free time / Bringing work home

For 95% of the time your work life is a marathon, not a sprint. This means we have to rest, recouperate and be ready for the next week too. Because there's always the next week, the next release and so on. They don't need to be temples but take care of your mind and body decently well. You'll need both.

Of course there's always some grind before an important release, but if you're at a company where they have a lot of grind and don't value your free time maybe think about moving.

This is a two parter:
1) Doing what we enjoy
2) "I should do more"

## Doing what we love 

For a lot of developers we're getting paid for doing what we enjoy, what we do in our free time.
This can lead to worklife and homelife blending together into one, giving the brain little or no rest. Take it from one who's burnt out, it's unpleasant. I'd really advise against it.

## I should do more

Have you had a slow day? did you expect to get more done but suddently the clock skipped a couple of hours? That's ok, we all have slow days. Go home, rest up and you get another crack at it tomorrow.

# How long should this take?

The billion dollar question which has plagued software engineering for the last 50 year; time estimates. In short there's a lot of ways to do it, some don't do it but in general you shouldn't have to worry about this as a new developer. You and your team work together on your estimates, if you're more alone on that specific task either ask somebody more senior for help with estimating it or tell your boss that your estimate has a very high degree of uncertainity.

# Handling failure

If something doesn't go according to plan let people know, they'll help you clean it up and you learn to not do that again. If it's A LOT of cleanup maybe bring cookies or buy them a beer or something, that's always appreciated.

Do not try to hide it or you might make it so much worse.

# Education

How can these points be taught in the best way? I'm not sure. Suggestions very welcome.
